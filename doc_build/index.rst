Introduction
============

Pyleoclim is a Python package designed for the analysis of paleoclimate data.
Pyleoclim leverages various data science libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for time series analysis, as well as and Matplotlib and Cartopy for the creation of publication-quality figures. The package is designed around object-oriented :ref:`Series <core_ui>`, which can be directly manipulated for plotting, spectral and wavelet analysis, and other time series-appropriate operations. Basic familiarity with Python is essential, and many good tutorials exist on the topic.

Pyleoclim natively "speaks" the language of Linked Paleo Data  (`LiPD <http://lipd.net>`_), which enables it to handle most of the data transformations internally, taking a good chunk of the pain out of analyzing paleoclimate data.
The package is aware of age ensembles stored via LiPD and uses them for time-uncertain analysis. Age ensembles can be generated through the `GeoChronR <http://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/>`_ package, which natively stores them as ensemble tables in LiPD.

While convenient for the representation of paleoclimate observations, LiPD is not the only point of entry into Pyleoclim. The :ref:`Series <core_ui>` class is very flexible, and allows to apply Pyleoclim functionality to virtually any timeseries, including instrumental or model-generated data, as Excel spreadsheets, numpy arrays or pandas dataframes. Indeed, Pyleoclim is the workhorse supporting more general `machine-learning functionalities <https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/autoTS>`_ for all manner of timeseries.
